# Carbon Open Questions
**Status:** v1 — team review

Only unresolved human-owned questions belong here. Resolved architecture belongs in `DECISIONS.md`.

## P0 science
- **OQ-001 — First LIVE challenge envelope.** Exact parameters, BC/IC classes, exclusions, and stress taxonomy. **Owner:** Physics/SciML lead.
- **OQ-002 — First LIVE generator dossier.** Exact reference evidence and coverage required to qualify that envelope. **Owner:** Physics/SciML lead.
- **OQ-003 — First LIVE Score Pack.** Exact hard gates, thresholds, within-leg weights, robustness categories, and approved deviations from the 45/30/25 P0 baseline. **Owner:** Physics + protocol.
- **OQ-004 — Backend reproducibility tolerance.** Acceptable numerical tolerance for repeated official training/evaluation on the qualified stack. **Owner:** SciML + infra.

## Randomness / protocol
- **OQ-005 — Phase-0 seed timing.** Exact chain event/block timing and nonce lifecycle that makes randomness unavailable when a miner commits while preserving reproducibility. **Owner:** Protocol/Bittensor.
- **OQ-006 — Production beacon qualification.** Select and security-review the production strengthening path and fallback policy. **Owner:** Security + protocol.
- **OQ-007 — Validator disagreement procedure.** Retry/contested-result behavior when outputs exceed qualified reproducibility tolerance. **Owner:** Protocol + ops.

## Security / execution
- **OQ-008 — P0 strategy execution threat model.** Confirm the permitted submission capability surface and isolation controls for hostile miner-controlled input. **Owner:** Security + protocol.
- **OQ-009 — Disclosure budget validation.** Demonstrate that EvaluationCard plus repeated querying does not create a practical exam-reconstruction oracle. **Owner:** Security + agent engineering.

## Economics / operations
- **OQ-010 — Exam fee.** Set P0 fee policy; fee remains forbidden from scientific score. **Owner:** Protocol/economics.
- **OQ-011 — Submission/rate limits.** Set P0 rate limits/resource classes from measured validator cost and queue behavior. **Owner:** Ops/economics.
- **OQ-012 — Validator operating envelope.** Supported hardware, resource limits, retry policy, and minimum reliability for testnet/LIVE qualification. **Owner:** Infra/protocol.

## Qualification / ownership
- **OQ-013 — Sign-off owners.** Name authorized approvers for envelope, dossier, Score Pack, backend, security review, MCP readiness, and Launch Bar. **Owner:** Team.
- **OQ-014 — First LIVE flip.** Select the exact challenge/version once all qualification evidence is complete. **Owner:** Protocol + physics lead.
- **OQ-015 — Product Qualification Pack v1.** Before the first commercial SKU, define product-specific PB thresholds, hardware profile, operating certificate, and requalification triggers. **Owner:** Product + physics + protocol.

## Explicitly not open
Shared-vs-per-validator exam identity, binary hard gates, weighted-geometric aggregation, P0 45/30/25 baseline, universal-P0-UQ, public-physics/hidden-realization, reference-cache role, Port-B variable grading, winning-strategy candidacy, and P0-one-vertical-first are resolved by the reconciled specs.
